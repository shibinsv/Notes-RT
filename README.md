**Notes-RT**
1. This application is designed for the purpose of creating, displaying, modifying, and removing notes.
2. The central route is the "userData" path, under which new child elements are stored.
3. The application utilizes **Firebase Realtime Database** to manage all database operations.
4. PS: As this is a compact application with limited functionalities, a single activity and ViewModel have been employed.
